For climate sensors and soil moisture
-------------------------------------

- lab laptop with iButton software
- iButton cables and extra sensors
- electrical repair tools and connectors: wire stripper, electrical tape, gel connectors
- zip ties
- GPSs - check batteries and waypoints
- extra batteries
- sensor list (printed)
- decagon software, cable
- extra sensors
- shovel

- nails 8d 2.5 inch work well
- hammer
- wire for tagging small trees
- wire cutters
- flagging

For plant ecophys
-----------------

- water potential: pressure bombs and accessory cases. Check parts, headlamps, hand lenses
- nitrogen tanks. Check pressures. We need > 1800 PSI in general
- data sheets with list of tagged trees (Oak plot, DOSE plots) 
- leaf life span: data sheets & rulers
- ziplocks
- LICOR 6400.  Check soda lime and dessicant, extra CO2, Batteries (12 or so usually), battery charger
- LICOR LAI meter
  
Stem and leaf collection (xylem hydraulics, freezing tests)
-----------------------------------------------------------

- water containers (10+ gallons)
- large ziplocks, large plastic garbage bags
- collection containers (shampoo bottles)
- parafilm
- ziplocs for leaves
- good clippers
- large cooler(s)
- ladders (if needed)

For prescribed burns
--------------------
- fireloger system: loggers and thermcouples, wire stakes/u-stakes
- laptop with HOBO software

For grass flammability field collection
---------------------------------------
 
- 1m * 1m quadrat
- clippers
- fuel moisture bottles
- ziplock for leaves 
- large plastic bag and storage box for plants
- markers and tape
- shovel 
- community sampling datasheets and clipboards
- DBH tape and tree tags when monitoring tree status is included
- GPS and battery
- Li-cor line light meter
- 50 m or 100 m transect tape
- random number generator (laptop with R installed is enough)

For grass flammability in-door burning
--------------------------------------
- laptop and charger for balance data reading
- HOBO data logger and thermocouple sensors, check battery
- two balances (one for mass loss rate and another for sample weighing) and charger
- extension cord
- tripod and lamp 
- lighter, tong, cotton balls and 50% ethanol solution for ignition 
- cooler with ice for subsample storage
- brush and metal box for fuel residuals collection
- foil for pot protection
- aluminum sheet to put between balance and plant to catch fell biomass during combustion
- cardboard topped with metal sheet work as base and buffer to support balance as well as minimize effect of ground disturbance (observer walking etc.) on balance reading
- bandana
- 2 m metal rule for flame height reading
- timer for all kinds of time duration recording
- Kestrel pocket weather meter (calibration need)
- HOBO data logger cord
- data sheet and pencil
- trash bags to clean and collect any trash after experiments, make sure nothing is still smoldering before trash them 

  
Camping and safety gear
-----------------------

- food
- large water containers fill with RO water
- coolers - ice
