For tree tagging
----------------

- diameter tapes
- tree tags (check numbers, ranges, type are all correct). Do you have enough?
- nails 8d 2.5 inch work well
- hammer
- wire for tagging small trees
- wire cutters
- flagging

For plant ecophys
-----------------

- water potential: pressure bombs and accessory cases. Check parts, headlamps, hand lenses
- nitrogen tanks. Check pressures. We need > 1800 PSI in general
